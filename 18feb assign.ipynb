    "2. Advantages : \n",
    "  a. API solutions enable different software systems to communicate with each other, regardless of their programming language or platform. \n",
    "  b.  API driven infrastructures enable developers to reuse code and functionality from existing software systems, saving time and reducing the amount of code that needs to be written from scratch.\n",

    "  Disadvantages : \n",
    "  a.  security concerns, complexity, compatibility issues, dependency on third-party developers, and governance and management issues.\n",
    "  b. API infrastructures can be vulnerable to security breaches, such as SQL injection attacks and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, making it crucial to implement security measures to protect against these threats.\n",
    "  c. APIs can be complex, requiring a significant amount of development effort to implement and maintain."

    "When a request for data is sent to a REST API, itâ€™s usually done through hypertext transfer protocol (commonly referred to as HTTP). Once a request is received, APIs designed for REST (called RESTful APIs or RESTful web services) can return messages in a variety of formats: HTML, XML, plain text, and JSON. \n",

SOAP web services offer built-in security and transaction compliance that align with many enterprise needs, but that also makes them heavier. Additionally, many public APIs, like the Google Maps API, follow the REST guidelines."
